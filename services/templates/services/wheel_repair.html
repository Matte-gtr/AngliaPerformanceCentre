                            If you have a crack in your alloy wheels, you need to get it repaired as soon as possible, otherwise the crack can 
                            escalate, causing air to leak from your type and compromising the stability, and thus safety of your vehicle.<br><br>
                            At APC, we are able to repair cracked and bent alloy wheels using the following method;
                            <ul>
                                <li>First the crack is traced</li>
                                <li>A relief hole is drilled at the end of the crack to stop it spreading</li>
                                <li>The crack is V-grooved</li>
                                <li>The crack is welded</li>
                                <li>The surface is refinished to its previous form</li>
                            </ul>
                            Unfortunately, if a crack has escalated or the wheel is damaged past a certain point, it won't be possible to repair the wheel while keeping it's 
                            structural integrity in tact. If this is the case, our technicians will let you know and discuss your options moving forward.
