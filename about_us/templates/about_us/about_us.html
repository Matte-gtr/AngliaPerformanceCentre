                    Based our of Peterborough, Anglia Performance Centre was started back in 2011, this was a new chapter for me as I was a one man band, 
                    working from home. I Started as a VW apprentice, then moved on to University, and by a stroke 
                    of luck whilst working for Suzuki, I was approached to join a drag racing team. Following on from there,
                    I ammased my tools, rolling road and moved into my new premises. The rest is 
                    history. 
                    One of the things thats sets us apart from many in the industry these days is our honesty policy;
                    we wont lie to people and will always share our honest opinion. We try to be as 
                    transparent and honest as possible and are always willing to help. We are also always 
                    looking to push the boundaries to meet customers requirements and expectations, whether that's to fix your car, diagnose a fault,
                    set your car up for the race track or completely rebuild your car from the ground up.
